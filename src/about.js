<p>This tool is the little brother of Tyria2D brought up to you by <a href="https://github.com/njibhu/">Njibhu (Aquila.4832)</a><br />
  It relies on the <a href="https://github.com/njibhu/Tyria3DLibrary/">Tyria3DLibrary</a>, but it is also using a few open source projects:<br />
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://threejs.org/">Three.js</a> for the rendering </li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/kig/DataStream.js/">Datastream</a> for the binary data handling </li>
    <li><a href="http://w2ui.com/">w2ui</a> and <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> for the ui </li>
  </ul>
  The entirety of the content you can explore with this app is crafted by the very talented people at <a href="https://www.arena.net/">ArenaNet</a>.<br />
  <br />
